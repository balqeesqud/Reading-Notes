# Data structures & algorithms

```
Data structures and algorithms form the backbone of computer science and software development, providing

the essential building blocks to efficiently solve real-world problems. Learning these fundamental concepts empowers

individuals to analyze, optimize, and implement algorithms that can process vast amounts of data.

```

- ## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

```
time complexity of the operations that will be performed on the data.
```

- ## How can we ensure that we’ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

```
 When creating a recursive function, you have to tell when to stop.
 every recursive function has two parts: base case & recursive case.
 the recursive case is when the function calls itself, while the base  
 case when function doesn’t call itself again

```

- ## Things I want to know more about

```
I would be interested in understanding the comparisons between different data structures and algorithms in terms
of time complexity, space complexity.
```
