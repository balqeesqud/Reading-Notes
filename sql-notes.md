# Databases & SQL Notes

## Relational Databases

```

Is a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores data in a structured manner, using tables with rows and columns.
Each table represents an entity or concept, and each row in the table represents a specific instance of that entity, while each column represents an attribute or property of the entity.

```

## SQL (Structured Query Language)

```

 - SQL is a standard language used to interact with relational databases. It allows users to perform various operations on the data, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.

 - The main SQL commands include SELECT (for querying data), INSERT (for adding new records), UPDATE (for modifying existing records), DELETE (for removing records.

 - SQL queries use the SELECT statement to retrieve data from one or more tables based on specified conditions, often using the WHERE clause to filter the results.
