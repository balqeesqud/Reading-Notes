# Implementation: Graphs

## Graph Traversal Vocabulary/Definition List:
  - Graph: A mathematical structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes.
  - Vertex (Node): A fundamental unit in a graph that represents a point or entity.
  - Edge: A connection between two vertices in a graph, representing a relationship or interaction.
  - Directed Graph: A graph in which edges have a direction, indicating a one-way relationship between vertices.
  - Undirected Graph: Definition: A graph in which edges have no direction, representing a symmetric relationship 
    between vertices.
  - Graph Traversal: The process of visiting all vertices and edges of a graph in a systematic way.
  - Depth-First Search (DFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before
    backtracking.
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph level by level, visiting all 
    neighbors of a node before moving on to the next level.
  - Connected Graph: A graph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices.
  - Disconnected Graph: A graph with at least two vertices for which there is no path between them.
  - Cycle: A closed path in a graph, where the last vertex is connected to the first vertex.
  - Adjacent Vertices: Vertices that are directly connected by an edge.
  - Graph Representation: Methods used to represent a graph in computer memory, such as adjacency matrix or adjacency
    list.
  - Traversal Order: The sequence in which vertices are visited during graph traversal.
  - Connected Component: A subgraph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices.
  - Path: A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge.
  - Algorithmic Complexity: The analysis of the efficiency of graph traversal algorithms in terms of time and space.
  - Topological Sorting: Definition: An ordering of the vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for 
    every directed edge, the destination vertex comes before the source vertex.
  - Traversal Stack (DFS): A data structure used in DFS to keep track of vertices to visit.
  - Traversal Queue (BFS): A data structure used in BFS to manage the order of vertices to visit.
