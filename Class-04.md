# Class 04

## Things I want to know more about
 -  To learn more about Object Oriented Programming. 

## ** Object-Oriented Programming Concepts**

1. Explain the difference between an object and a class.

   object: An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior.
   Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that
   you find in everyday life. 

   Class: is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. This 
   section defines a class that models the state and behavior of a real-world object.

2. Name two types of state that a Student object might have.
   Name, age, StudentId, grade. 

3. Name two types of behaviours that a student object might have.
   - study()
   - takeExam()
   - calculateGPA()


## **Classes**

1. Explain the significance of a constructor for a class.

   Its key roles include:

   1. Initialization: by setting up initial values for object attributes, to ensure objects are in a valid state.
   2. Parameterization: accept parameters to create objects with specific values.
   3. Valid State: Constructors prevent objects from being in an invalid state by enforcing attribute requirements.
   4. Overloading: Multiple constructors with different parameters enable versatile object creation.
   5. Inheritance: Constructors assist in initializing attributes of both subclass and superclass.

    
2. Write the declaration statement for a class named “Student” (do not fill it with fields and methods). 
   ```
   public class Student {
    
   }
   ```


## **Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers**

1. What is the value of the binary number 1101?

   is equivalent to 13.

2. Write the number 52 in binary. Write it in hexidecimal.

   Binary of 52: 110100.
   Hexadecimal of 52: 34.
