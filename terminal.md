# Terminal Practice

## The Command Line (or terminal)

```
Is a text-based interface used to interact with the operating system through commands. It allows users to perform
various tasks such as navigating the file system, managing files, and executing programs. I accessed the command
line on Linux by opening the Terminal application.
```

 Common commands I used recently:

- pwd (print working directory)
- ls (list files and directories)
- cd (change directory)
- mkdir (make directory)
- touch (create files)
- rm (remove files).

## Basic Navigation

```
In the Linux directory system, directories are organized in a hierarchical tree structure.
The root directory is denoted by /, and users can navigate through directories using the cd command.
Relative paths start from the current directory, while absolute paths start from the root directory.
```

Special directories:

- ` . `  (current directory)
- ` .. `  (parent directory)
- ` ~ `  (home directory).

## More About Files

```
Linux treats everything as a file, including directories, devices, and regular files.
File permissions: Linux has three types of permissions (read, write, and execute).
```

- `ls -l`   to see detailed file information, including permissions, ownership, size, and modification time.

## Manual Pages

```
Linux provides manual pages (man command) to get detailed information about commands and their usage.
Manual pages consist of sections, and you can access them by typing man `command` in the terminal.
 ```

- Use q to exit the manual pages.

## File Manipulation

- cp is used to copy files and directories.
- mv is used to move or rename files or directories.
