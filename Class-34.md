# Publishing To The Google Play Store

  1. How are releases and versioning related?
     Releases and versioning are interconnected concepts in software development. Versioning involves assigning unique
     identifiers (versions) to different states of a software application, usually in a numerical format such as major.
     minor.patch. A release, on the other hand, is a specific version of the software made available to users, bundling 
     together features, improvements, or fixes.
     The relationship between releases and versioning is evident in the following aspects:
     - Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
     - Release Management
     - Changelog
  2. What are the five main tasks you need to complete to prepare your application for release to the Google Play Store?
     - **Version Bumping:**
    Task: Increase the version code and version name in the AndroidManifest.xml file.
    Purpose: Ensures that the new release is identified with a unique version number.
     - **Build Generation:**
    Task: Generate a signed APK (Android Package) file for the release.
    Purpose: Creates a distributable package of the application that can be uploaded to the Google Play Store.
     - **Testing:**
    Task: Conduct thorough testing of the application, including functional, performance, and compatibility testing.
    Purpose: Identifies and resolves any issues or bugs before the release is made available to users.
     - **Update Release Notes and Changelog:**
    Task: Update the release notes and changelog to reflect the changes made in the new version.
    Purpose: Provides users with information about new features, improvements, and bug fixes.
     - **Google Play Console Configuration:**
    Task: Log in to the Google Play Console, create a new release, and upload the signed APK file.
    Purpose: Makes the new version of the application available for distribution on the Google Play Store
