## **Java OO Tutorial (review Object and Class, read the rest)**

   1. What is the difference between an Object and a Class in Java?

      object: An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior.
      Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that
      you find in everyday life. 

      Class: is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. This 
      section defines a class that models the state and behavior of a real-world object.


   2. Explain to a non-technical friend the concept of inheritance in Java.

      provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software.
      This section explains how classes inherit state and behavior from their superclasses, and 
      explains how to derive one class from another using the simple syntax provided by the Java
      programming language.


##  **Java Static Keyword**

   
   1. Static methods are also called what? Why?

      Called as class methods
      It is because a static method belongs to the class rather than the object of a class.

   2. How can you access a variable of a class without instantiating an object from that class?

      We are able to access the static variable and method directly without using the class name. It
      is because static variables and methods are by default public. And, since we are accessing from 
      the same class, we don't have to specify the class name.


## **Java Singleton Class**

  
   1. What is a Design Pattern? Describe one or two with analogies from your previous work experience.

      design pattern is like a code library that includes various coding techniques shared by programmers around the world.

    - Builder Pattern:

       The Builder Pattern is a design pattern that focuses on creating complex objects by breaking down 
       the construction process into smaller, manageable steps. It separates the construction of an object
       from its representation, allowing for flexible and clear object creation. This pattern is analogous 
       to a house builder following a blueprint to systematically construct a house with various attributes,
       enhancing code organization and reusability.


    - Observer Pattern

      The Observer Pattern is a design pattern that facilitates the communication between different components
      of a system by establishing a subscription-based relationship. In this pattern, an object (the subject) 
      maintains a list of its dependents (observers), and when the subject undergoes a change, all its observers 
      are automatically notified and updated. This pattern is akin to a news agency notifying subscribers about new 
      articles, enabling loose coupling between subjects and observers and promoting efficient communication within
      a software system.

   2. What is a Singleton?

      a design pattern that ensures that a class can only have one object.
