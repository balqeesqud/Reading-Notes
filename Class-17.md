      OAuth is a framework that allows application to securely access and use data or services from another 
      application without needing to store or share the user's login credentials. In simple terms, it provides a way 
      for users to grant limited and controlled access to their data to a third-party application. This is commonly 
      used for features like social login, where you can sign in to a website or app using your existing Google, 
      Facebook, or GitHub account, without creating a new username and password. 
      OAuth ensures that application can access only the specific data or functions that the user permits, and it does
      so without exposing sensitive information like passwords. It enhances security, user convenience, and 
      interoperability between different services
