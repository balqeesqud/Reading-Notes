## Don’t Repeat Yourself but consider the Rule of Three

   1. Are there any projects that you’ve built during your time at Code Fellows (or prior) which could benefit
      from applying the Rule of Three to DRY up your code?
      Yes, a project I have worked on the Prep period. 

   2. Explain how you would dry up your code if you noticed that you are repeating the same logic in multiple places?
      If I notice repeated logic in multiple places, I would create a separate function or module to encapsulate that 
      logic and then call that function/module wherever the repetition occurs, promoting code reusability and maintainability.


## You Aren’t Gonna Need It and Minimum Viable Product

   1. Describe some benefits of releasing an MVP of a product.
      - Early User Feedback: Users can provide feedback on the core functionality, helping to shape the product's direction.
      - Faster Time to Market: You can get a basic version of your product into the hands of users sooner, gaining a competitive advantage.
      - Cost Efficiency: Developing only essential features initially reduces development costs and resource requirements.
      - Validation of Concept: MVP helps validate whether your product idea solves a real problem and has a market demand.


   2. What are some potential pitfalls of waiting until a product is fully mature to release it.

      - Missed Opportunities: Delaying release may allow competitors to capture market share, leaving you at a disadvantage.
      - Uncertain Relevance: Developing for a long time without user input increases the risk of building features users don't actually want.
      - Resource Drain: Extensive development without user feedback can consume resources on unnecessary or overly complex features.
      - Slow ROI: Developer won't start generating revenue until the product is fully mature, prolonging the time to achieve return on investment.
