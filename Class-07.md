### While I was studying the types of Inheritance, I knew that the multiple Inheritance type is not supported in java, Why? 

Java Developers want to use multiple inheritance in some cases. Fortunatley, Java developers have interface concepts expecting 
the developers to achieve multiple inheritance by using multiple INTERFACES. 

## Things I want to know more about

- To know the difference between the Inheritance and Interface.
