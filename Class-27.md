# SharedPreferences, Passing Data With Extras, And Integration Testing


 1. What is a technology youâ€™ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?
    Cookies

 2. Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.
   - Identifying and Preventing Bugs and Errors
     it directly impacts product reliability, user satisfaction, and overall project success. By identifying and
     preventing bugs and errors early in the development cycle, organizations can save time, resources, and avoid 
     potential disasters. A product or system riddled with issues can lead to a host of problems, including security 
     vulnerabilities, data loss, system crashes, and dissatisfied users.
   - Continuous Improvement
   - Quality Assurance
   - Risk Management

 3. Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.
    An analogy for tasks and the back stack in mobile app development could be compared to a stack of plates in a 
    kitchen. Each plate represents an activity in the app, and the stack of plates represents the task or the sequence 
    of activities that users interact with. Here's how the analogy works:
   - Stack of Plates: Imagine a stack of plates, one on top of the other. This stack is similar to the back stack in 
     app. When starting a new task (or cooking a new dish in our kitchen), a new plate (activity) is added to the top 
     of the stack.

   - Adding a Plate: When opening an app or starting a new task, it's like adding a new plate to the top of the stack. 
     Each plate (activity) represents a step in the process. Taking a Plate: As interacting with the app, we move 
     through the activities, similar to taking plates off the top of the stack to work on them.

   - Returning a Plate: When finishing an activity or task, it's like returning the plate to the top of the stack. 
     It's still there, but we're not actively working on it.

   - Removing a Plate: When you press the "Back" button, it's like removing the top plate (activity) from 
     the stack, as we've finished with it.

   - Last In, First Out (LIFO): The stack of plates follows a last in, first out (LIFO) order, just like the back stack.
     The last plate you added is the first one you work on or remove.

   - Home Screen: When you're done with all the tasks or activities, it's like having an empty stack of plates, similar 
     to returning to the Home screen.

  and its similar to the call stack in data structure.
