#  Stream Processing Using Collections And Lambdas

## Purely functional programming, from Wikipedia

 1. Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?
    In functional programming, data structures are typically treated as immutable, meaning that once they are created,
    they cannot be modified. Instead of changing the state of a data structure, functional programming encourages 
    creating new data structures with the desired changes, leaving the original data structures unchanged.

 2. Define purely functional programming.
    Designates a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats 
    all computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.

 3. How do you think purely functional programming will differ from the programs you’ve written so far in this course?
    - Functional Purity vs. Impurity.
    - Immutability vs. Mutability.
    - Recursion vs. Loops.
    - First-Class and Higher-Order Functions.
    - Avoidance of Mutable State.
    - Evaluation Strategies

## Things I want to know more about

 - Practice writing pure functions and avoiding side effects.
 - Practice writing code with immutability, avoiding mutable state, and using higher-order functions extensively.
