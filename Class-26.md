#  Android Basicsâ€”Activities, Layouts, Event Handlers, And Intents

## Android fundamentals

1. What is the Intent on Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it.
   an "Intent" is a fundamental component used to perform various actions in an Android application, 
   such as:
   - starting new activities
   - sending or receiving data
   - triggering system services.
   Intents act as a message-passing mechanism between different components of an app or between different apps, 
   allowing them to interact with each other.
   
2. Describe an Activity in your own word.
   An activity is the entry point for interacting with the user. It represents a single screen with a user interface.
   For example, an email app might have one activity that shows a list of new emails, another activity to compose an 
   email, and another activity for reading emails. Although the activities work together to form a cohesive user 
   experience in the email app, each one is independent of the others.



## Things I want to know more about

  - Understanding and knowing how activities are created, started, paused, resumed, stopped, and destroyed. 
  - Learn about creating user-friendly and visually appealing user interfaces.
